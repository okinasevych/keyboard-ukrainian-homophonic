ukrainian-keyboard
==================

This is a keyboard layout for Ukrainian, based on the QWERTY keyboard. The layout is homophonic, meaning that most of the Ukrainian language characters are mapped to their English-language sound-alikes. 

The layout was generated using the Ukelele keyboard layout editor.
